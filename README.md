#  :telephone_receiver: GSM Simulation Program in Java :telephone:

This README file provides an overview and instructions for using the GSM Simulation Program implemented in Java. The GSM Simulation Program is a simple simulator that mimics the functioning of a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network.

## :clipboard: Overview

The GSM Simulation Program aims to replicate the behavior of a basic GSM network with mobile devices and cell towers. It allows users to create and manage mobile devices, cell towers, and simulate communication between them.


## :memo: Requirements
To run the GSM Simulation Program, you need the following:

* :coffee: Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.

## :rocket: Getting Started
* Clone the Repository: Clone the GSM Simulation Program repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
* Compile the Code: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root folder of the cloned repository, and compile the Java source files using the following command:

```bash
javac Main.java
```
Run the Program: Once the code is successfully compiled, execute the program using the following command:

```bash
java Main
```
